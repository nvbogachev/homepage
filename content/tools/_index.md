### Software Tools

- AlVin: a software implementation of Vinberg's algorithm by Rafael Guglielmetti, see the [GitHub](https://github.com/rgugliel/AlVin) project and the full [documentation](https://rgugliel.github.io/AlVin/).

- CoxIter: a program (created by Rafael Guglielmetti) computing invariants of Coxeter polytopes and checking compactness and volume finiteness. See the [GitHub](https://github.com/rgugliel/CoxIter) project, the full [documentation](https://rgugliel.github.io/CoxIter/index.html), and [Web version](https://coxiterweb.rafaelguglielmetti.ch/).

- [VinAl](https://github.com/aperep/vinberg-algorithm): a software implementation of Vinberg's algorithm created by Sasha Perepechko and me.

- [PLoF](https://github.com/sashakolpakov/plof): a program computing lower dimensional faces of Coxeter polytopes created by Sasha Kolpakov in the framework of our paper.
