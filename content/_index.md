## About

I am a mathematician with research interests in hyperbolic geometry and geometry of discrete groups. In 2014, I graduated from Moscow State University under the supervision of [Professor **Ernest B. Vinberg**](http://halgebra.math.msu.su/wiki/doku.php/staff:vinberg:english) (see also [here](http://www.ams.org/distribution/mmj/vol8-4-2008/vinberg-birthday.html)). My [PhD thesis](pdf/Bogachev-PhD-2018.pdf) under his supervision was successfully defended in March 2019. Here you can find my [CV](pdf/cv-Bogachev-NV.pdf), papers, information about my projects and the materials of my teaching courses.

**Education:**

  - PhD in Mathematics, 2019, Higher School of Economics

  - MSc in Mathematics, 2014, Moscow State University


**Awards**

  - 2017, 2018: The Simons Foundation Prize for PhD students.
