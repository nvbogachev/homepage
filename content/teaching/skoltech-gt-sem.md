# The Skoltech Geometry & Topology Seminar (in Russian)

Here is a webpage of ongoing seminar at the Skoltech Center for Advanced Studies lead by Prof. A. Gaifullin. The main goal of this seminar is to analyze and discuss either some general topics or specific papers devoted to interactions between geometry, topology, and algebra. Each semester usually consists of a few (or just one) mini-courses given by young or senior participants/researchers in **Russian**.
