# Biography

I am a mathematician with research interests in Hyperbolic Geometry and Geometry of Discrete Reflection Groups. 
In 2014 I finished Moscow State University under the supervision of 
[Professor E.B. Vinberg](http://halgebra.math.msu.su/wiki/doku.php/staff:vinberg:english) (see also this [paper](http://www.ams.org/distribution/mmj/vol8-4-2008/vinberg-birthday.html)). 
My PhD under his supervision will be finished in 2018.
Currently I am a Lecturer and a Research Scientist at MIPT. 

In 2017 I received the Simons Foundation Prize for PhD students.
Here you can find my [CV](pdf/cv-Bogachev-NV.pdf), papers, information about my projects, and also the materials of my
teaching courses.
